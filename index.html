<h2>About</h2>
<p>Im a martial artist mostly tkd, and muay thai. a goofball. A pshyclolghy mind very spiritul, gamer, and anime lover. A Sagittarius So that means I am very, very optimistic. I do take things in life seriously but I tend to relax more often because well why take it seriously we already have enough. I will personally read by comedic movies so I left to cover my Pain I found it. I have a lot of knowledge in things that are random. It's like I play games I watch anime. I learn my stars and then for some reason I decided to find out some plumbing skills turns out it's really not that hard. It's just like you take things off that look like they fit kind of like an a puzzl, do things slowly to see how they fit back on the problem and then put the peaches back in. I do have a disability so that's probably why I try to be happy because I mean, what's the point of wishing to get something fixed that is either definitely not going away and if you tried to fix it, it might make things worse, so just live with it and live happy. </p>
